# irsdkpy-ino
Establish the connection between the irsdkpy and arduino for different applications.

# Description
This project establishes a connection between a iRacing and an Arduino microcontroller via Python using (pyirsdk)[https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk]. The code captures real-time data generated by the simulator and sends it to the Arduino over a serial connection. These data can be used for various applications, such as simulating physical indicators, controlling motors, or integrating into IoT systems.
